With the help of sentiment analysis we can do variety of things some of which are: 1.Judge whether a movie is good or not by knowing the sentiments of the tweets that mention them. 2.Get the opinion of public on some important political issue 3.Help curb the spread of hate speech. So with that lets start the project by reading the data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6f1e4da6-4862-4e6b-a40e-dd4b484e5504","metadata":{"id":"6f1e4da6-4862-4e6b-a40e-dd4b484e5504"},"source":["#
